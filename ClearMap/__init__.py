*ClearMap* is a python toolbox for the analysis and registration of volumetric 
data from cleared tissues obtained with Light Sheet microscopy.

The ClearMap code package is structured into four main modules:

   * **IO** for reading and writing images and data
   * **Alignment** for resampling, reorientation and registration of images onto references
   * **Image Processing** for correcting and quantifying the image data
   * **Analysis** for the statistical analysis of the data

*ClearMap* is a toolbox for the analysis and registration of volumetric
data from cleared tissues.

*ClearMap's* tool box includes 

* [Wobbly-Stitcher](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/wobblystitcher.html), 

* [TubeMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/tubemap.html),

  [![TubeMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/images/TubeMap_graph_movie_small.gif)](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/TubeMap.html)

* [CellMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/cellmap.html)

*ClearMap* has been designed to analyze O(TB) 3d datasets obtained 
via light sheet microscopy from iDISCO+ cleared tissue samples 
immunolabeled for proteins. 
 
*ClearMap* has been written for mapping immediate early genes [Renier2016]_
as well as vasculature networks of whole mouse brains [Kirst2020]_

*ClearMap* tools may also be useful for data obtained with other types of 
microscopes, types of markers, clearing techniques, as well as other species,
organs, or samples.

*ClearMap* is written in Python 3 and is designed to take advantage of
parallel processing capabilities of modern workstations. We hope the open 
structure of the code will enable many new modules to be added to *ClearMap*
to broaden the range of applications to different types of biological objects 
or structures.




Installation
------------

Install ClearMap by cloning it form `github <http://www.github.com/>`_::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap.git

See `GIT.md <https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap/blob/master/GIT.md>`_ for basic help with git.

If you want to register data to reference images via elastix or
classify pixels via ilastik configure the /ClearMap/Settings.py file.

You will most likely also need to install several python packages e.g. via 
pip or apt-get.

See the `documentation <https://rawgit.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap/master/docs/_build/html/index.html>`_ for more details.

Additional files for mouse brain registration can be found on the `iDISCO website <https://idisco.info/>`_.

# Contribute to ClearMap

ClearMap is an actively developed package and we welcome community development and involvement. 

We are especially seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in OSS to contribute their expertise 
and experience. Please get in touch if you want to discuss specific contributions you are interested
in developing, and we can help shape a road-map.

We are happy to receive code extensions, bug fixes, documentation updates, etc.

If you want to contribute to the code, please make a pull request that includes both a summary of and changes to:

* how you modified the code and what new functionality it has
* the OS it has been tested on
* a working example of how it works for users.

If you have any questions, please reach out: clearmap.idisco@gmail.com
